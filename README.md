# SMS_SPAM_NLP_Project:

SMS Spam Prediction Using NLP Concepts, is a sophisticated application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to classify SMS messages as either spam or legitimate. In this project, you employed AdaBoost technology alongside the Naive Bayes machine learning model to achieve high accuracy in prediction.

The process began with comprehensive data preparation, transformation, and vectorization, which are crucial steps for converting raw text data into a format that machine learning models can understand. You leveraged the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) libraries to perform text processing tasks, such as tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming, ensuring that the data was optimally structured for analysis.

By integrating AdaBoost, you enhanced the performance of the Naive Bayes classifier, resulting in a more robust and accurate spam detection system. Your project demonstrates the effectiveness of combining machine learning with NLP techniques to address real-world problems like spam detection, contributing to more secure and efficient communication.
